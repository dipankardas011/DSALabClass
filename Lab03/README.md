# Questions
* WAP to create a linked list that represents a polynomial expression with single variable (i.e. 5x7-3x5+x2+9) and display the polynomial by using user defined functions for creation and display.
* WAP by modifying the LA1 program to add two polynomials with single variable. Use the same function in LA1 written for creation & display operations and write a new function for addition operations.
* A matrix m × n that has relatively few non-zero entries is called sparse matrix. It may be represented in much less than m × n space. An m × n matrix with k non-zero entries is sparse if k << m × n. It may be faster to represent the matrix compactly as a list of the non-zero indexes and associated entries. WAP to represent a sparse matrix using linked list.
* WAP to find out the transpose of a sparse matrix. 
* WAP to determine whether the given matrix is a sparse matrix or not.
