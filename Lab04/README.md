* WAP to create a double circular double linked list of n nodes and display the linked list by using suitable user defined functions for create and display operations.✅
* Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in a single circular linked list by using suitable user defined functions for each case.
    * Traverse the list 
    * Check if the list is empty 
    * Insert a node at the certain position
    * Delete a node at the certain position 
    * Delete a node for the given key
    * Count the total number of nodes 
    * Search for an element in the linked list
Verify & validate each function from main method.✅
* WAP to remove the duplicates in a sorted double linked list.✅
* WAP to convert a given singly linked list to a circular list.✅
* WAP to implement a doubly linked list by using singly linked.✅
* WAP to print the middle of a double linked list.✅
* Given a double linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.
