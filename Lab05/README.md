* WAP Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations of a stack using linked list by using suitable user defined functions for each case.✅
* WAP to convert an infix expression into its equivalent postfix notation✅
* WAP to convert an infix expression into its equivalent prefix notation.✅
* Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or { ) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and (). A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. WAP to determine whether the input sequence of brackets is balanced or not. If a string is balanced, it print YES on a new line; otherwise, print NO on a new line. 
Example: Input: {[()]} and Output: YES
Input: {[(])} and Output: NO✅

* In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “. WAP to find the stranger (celebrity) in minimum number of questions.✅
* WAP exhibiting Tower of Hanoi (recursive).✅
* WAP to implement a stack which will support three additional operations in addition to push and pop by modifying LA 1.
    - peekLowestElement - return the lowest element in the stack without removing it from the stack
    - peekHighestElement - return the highest element in the stack without removing it from the stack
    - peekMiddleElement - return the (size/2+1)th lowest element in the stack without removing it from the stack.✅
