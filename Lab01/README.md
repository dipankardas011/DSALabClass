# Questions

* WAP to find out the smallest and largest element stored in an array of n integers.✅
* WAP to reverse the contents of a dynamic array of n elements.✅
* WAP to search an element in a dynamic array of n numbers.✅
* WAP to sort a dynamic array of n numbers.✅
* Given an unsorted dynamic array of size n, WAP to find and display the number of elements between two elements a and b (both inclusive). E.g. Input : arr = [1, 2, 2, 7, 5, 4], a=2 and b=5, Output : 4 and the numbers are: 2, 2, 5, 4.✅

* Given a dynamic array, WAP to print the next greater element (NGE) for every element. The next greater element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1. E.g. For the input array [2, 5, 3, 9, 7], the next greater elements for each elements are as follows.✅

    Element | NGE
    --|--
    2 |	5
    5 |	9
    3 |	9
    9 |	-1
    7 |	-1

* Let A be nXn square dynamic matrix. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions for the following:
    * Find the number of nonzero elements in A
    * Find the sum of the elements above the leading diagonal.
    * Display the elements below the minor diagonal.
    * Find the product of the diagonal elements.✅

* Given an unsorted dynamic array arr and two numbers x and y, find the minimum distance between x and y in arr. The array might also contain duplicates. You may assume that both x and y are different and present in arr.
Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3}, x = 3, y = 6
Output: Minimum distance between 3 and 6 is 4. ✅
* WAP to find out the second smallest and second largest element stored in a dynamic array.✅
* WAP to arrange the elements of a dynamic array such that all even numbers are followed by all odd numbers.✅
* Write a program to replace every element in the dynamic array with the next greatest element present in the same array.✅
* WAP to replace every dynamic array element by multiplication of previous and next of an n element.✅
