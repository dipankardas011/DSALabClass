* WAP to implement a stack which will support three additional operations in addition to push and pop by modifying LA 1.
    - peekLowestElement - return the lowest element in the stack without removing it from the stack
    - peekHighestElement - return the highest element in the stack without removing it from the stack
    - peekMiddleElement - return the (size/2+1)th lowest element in the stack without removing it from the stack.✅
