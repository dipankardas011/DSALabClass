1. WAP to read an array of integers and search for an element using linear search.✅
1. WAP to read an array of integers and search for an element using binary search.✅
1. Given an array container and integer hunt. WAP to find whether hunt is present in container or not. If present, then triple the value of hunt and search again. Repeat these steps until hunt is not found. Finally return the value of hunt. 
    Input: container = {1, 2, 3} and hunt = 1 then Output: 9
    Explanation: Start with hunt = 1. Since it is present in array, it becomes 3. Now 3 is present in array and hence hunt becomes 9. Since 9 is a not present, program return 9.✅
1. WAP illustrating chain hashing (Separate chaining with linked list).✅
1. WAP illustrating following collision resolution technique:
    * “Open Addressing – Linear Search”✅
    * “Open Addressing - Quadratic Probing”✅ 
    * “Open Addressing - Double Hashing”.
1. Given a sorted array of length n, WAP to find the number in array that appears more than or equal to n/2 times. It can be assumed that such element always exists. 
    Input:  2 3 3 4 Output: 3 
    Input:  3 4 5 5 5 Output: 5✅
1. WAP illustrating the usage of “Hash Functions” namely Folding, Mid-square, Division, Subtraction, Digit extraction and Rotation Hashing methods.
