### LAs
1. WAP to sort an array of n dates in an ascending order using Bubble sort. Date structure is {day, month, year }
1. WAP to sort an array of n floats in an ascending order using selection sort.
1. WAP to sort an array of n integers in a descending order using insertion sort.
1. WAP to sort an array of n integers in an ascending order using merge sort.
1. WAP to sort an array of n doubles in a descending order using quick sort.

### HAs
1. WAP sort the n names in an alphabetical order.
1. WAP demonstrating bubble sort using linked list.
1. WAP to find the maximum difference between any two elements.
1. WAP to sort an array of n integers in an ascending order using radix sort.
1. WAP to sort an array of n integers in an ascending order using Heap sort.
1. WAP to input two arrays X and Y of positive integers, find number of pairs such that x^y > y^x where x is an element from X and y is an element from Y.
Examples:
    * Input: X = {2, 1, 6}, Y = {1, 5}, Output: 3, There are total 3 pairs where pow(x, y) is greater than pow(y, x) and pairs are (2, 1), (2, 5) and (6, 1)
    * Input: X = {10, 19, 18}, Y = {11, 15, 9}; Output: 2, There are total 2 pairs where pow(x, y) is greater than pow(y, x) and pairs are (10, 11) and (10, 15)
