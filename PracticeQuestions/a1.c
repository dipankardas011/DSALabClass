/*
Suppose there is a circle there are N petrol pumps on that circle You are given 2 sets of data
1. the amount of petrol that every petrol pump has
2. distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump

Calculate the first point from where a truck will be able to complete the circle (the truck will stop at each petrol pump and it has infinite capacity). expected time complexity is O(N) assume for 1 litre petrol the truck can go 1 unit of distance
*/
/**
 * @example let there be 4 petrol pumps with amount of petrol and distance to next petrol pump value pairs as {4,6}, {6,5}, {7,3} and {4,5}. the first point from where truck can make a circular tour is 2nd petrol pump output should be "start = 1" (index of 2nd petrol pump)
