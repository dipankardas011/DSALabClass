# Questions

* WAP to store n employee’s data such as employee name, gender, designation, department, basic pay. Calculate the gross pay of each employees as follows:
Gross pay = basic pay + HR + DA
HR=25% of basic and DA=75% of basic.✅
* WAP to add two distances (in km-meter) by passing structure to a function.✅
* Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in a single linked list by using suitable user defined functions for each case.
    a) Traversal of the list.✅
    b) Check if the list is empty.✅
    c) Insert a node at the certain position (at beginning/end/any position).✅
    d) Delete a node at the certain position (at beginning/end/any position).✅
    e) Delete a node for the given key.✅
    f) Count the total number of nodes.✅
    g) Search for an element in the linked list.✅
Verify & validate each function from main method.
* WAP to display the contents of a linked list in reverse order.✅
* WAP to print mth node from the last of a linked list of n nodes.✅

* Wap to find out if a Matrix is Sparse or not. ( Ask the user for a valid and invalid category of elements and calculate accordingly.)✅

* Write a menu driven program to

    *  Print the upper triangular Matrix✅
    * Print the lower triangular Matrix✅
    * Print the diagonal elements✅

* Write a menu driven program to

    *  Add 2 Matrices✅
    * Check condition and multiply 2 Matrices✅
    * Rotate a matrix 90 degree✅
    * Rotate a matrix 180 degree✅

* Wap to convert a general Sparse matrix to a diagonal matrix.
✅
* Wap to implement a Sparse matrix triplet representation using an array.

* WAP to search an element in a simple linked list, if found delete that node and insert that node at beginning. Otherwise display an appropriate message.✅
* WAP to count the number of occurrences of an element in a linked list of n nodes.✅
* WAP to reverse the first m elements of a linked list of n nodes.✅
* WAP to remove duplicates from a linked list of n nodes.✅
* Given a linked list which is sorted, WAP to insert an element into the linked list in sorted way.✅
* WAP to find number of occurrences of all elements in a linked list. ✅
* WAP to modify the linked list such that all even numbers appear before all the odd numbers in the modified linked list.✅
* WAP to check whether a singly linked list is a palindrome or not.✅
* A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list. WAP to detect a cycle in a linked list.✅
* WAP to reverse only even position nodes in a singly linked list.✅
* WAP to swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end in a Linked List✅
* Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes. (where k is an input to the function). If a linked list is given as 12->23->45->89->15->67->28->98->NULL and k = 3 then output will be 45->23->12->67->15->89->98->28->NULL.✅
* Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.✅
* WAP to remove the duplicates in a sorted double linked list.✅
